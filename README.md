# f1-tcs

New MRO telescope control interface for the F1 controller, written in Python via [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/gettingstarted.html) with the idea that it could be a useful tool for testing the new F1 telescope control system with UW's AUEG, as well as a tool for the 2025 class of ASTR 481 to use with the MRO. 

> Ideally, this would be an interim solution - eventually it would be good to reconcile this TCS with [Evora](https://sites.google.com/a/uw.edu/mro/) to have one central area for managing things. I haven't the patience or time to sort out React now though. 

## Getting started

Start a local virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`.
